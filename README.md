# Efficient Similar/Duplicate Sentence Search on Large Corpus LLMs

This repository contains the code for efficiently finding similar and duplicate sentences in a large corpus using language models (LLMs). The goal is to address the challenges associated with searching for duplicates and similar sentences in datasets containing more than 1 trillion words.

## Why Finding Duplicates and Similar Sentences Efficiently is Hard

When dealing with large datasets, finding duplicates and similar sentences efficiently becomes challenging due to the following reasons:

1. **Computational Complexity:** Processing large amounts of text data requires significant computational resources, including memory and processing power. Traditional algorithms can become slow and inefficient as the dataset size increases.

2. **Memory Constraints:** Storing and comparing all sentences in a large corpus can be memory-intensive. As the number of sentences grows, the memory requirements can become impractical, leading to performance issues.

3. **Scalability:** Searching for duplicates and similar sentences across a vast dataset requires scalable algorithms and data structures. Without efficient techniques, the search process can become prohibitively slow and hinder practical use cases.

## Issues with Big Datasets Containing over 1 Trillion Words

Working with datasets that contain more than 1 trillion words introduces additional challenges:

1. **Storage Requirements:** Storing the entire dataset in memory can be infeasible due to the sheer size. Efficient techniques are needed to minimize storage requirements while still allowing for effective search and comparison.

2. **Search Efficiency:** Traditional search methods may become extremely slow and inefficient when dealing with such massive datasets. Optimized algorithms and data structures are necessary to enable fast and scalable search operations.

## Utilizing Libraries to Solve the Problem

To address these challenges, the code in this repository employs the following libraries and techniques:

- `re` library: Used for text preprocessing, such as removing special characters and converting text to lowercase.

- `difflib` library: Provides the `SequenceMatcher` class, which is used to find similar sentences based on sequence matching.

- `datasketch` library: Utilized for generating MinHash signatures and creating a MinHash LSH (Locality Sensitive Hashing) index. MinHash is a technique that allows for efficient similarity estimation between sets, enabling the identification of similar sentences.

- `pybloom_live` library: Used to create a Scalable Bloom Filter, which is an efficient data structure for duplicate detection without excessive memory usage.

- `bitarray` library: Employed to store Bloom filters compactly. Bloom filters are probabilistic data structures used for efficient membership testing.

- `mmh3` library: Provides the MurmurHash3 hash function, used in conjunction with the Bloom filters to generate hash values for sentences.

By leveraging these libraries and techniques, the code aims to provide an efficient solution for finding similar and duplicate sentences in large datasets containing over 1 trillion words.

## Code Usage

To use the code in this repository, follow these instructions:

1. Install the required libraries: `datasketch`, `pybloom_live`, `bitarray`, `mmh3`.

   ```shell
   pip install datasketch pybloom_live bitarray mmh3
   
2. Modify the code as needed to specify your dataset or sentences to be analyzed.

3. Run the code to find similar and duplicate sentences efficiently.
